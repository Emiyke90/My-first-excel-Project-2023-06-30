# Intoduction:

This data analysis Project was hosted By CHISOM PROMISE and friends in one data analysis platform on telegram, and we were asked to apply three out of  the six phases of data analysis, which were:to PROCESS, to ANALYSE, and to SHARE insights and recommendations.These insights and recommendations are to help analysts(me inclusive) and businesses stakeholders understand sales and e-commerce territory in southern America, and especially, Brazil, and allow them identify and plan for growth. 
Olist,a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.
The sales data set is a collection of anonymized data about orders placed on the platform between January 2016 and August 2018. It contains a wide range of information about each order, including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. The data set also includes information about the sellers who list their products, as well as data on customer behavior and demographics. The data set is designed to help analysts and researchers better understand the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and identify opportunities for growth and optimization.
